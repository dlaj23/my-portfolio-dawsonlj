## Taking the Cheese

The wise tomcat stared at the cheese block
Would grabbing it be worth the scolding
Would it be worth being sprayed with the water bottle?
There was bound to be a punishment.
Should he nibble just a bit or take the whole thing?
Would the punishment be any different?
While he was deciding the dog ate the cheese.
